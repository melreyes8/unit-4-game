### Crytals Collector Game

As a Player loads the page, he/she will be given a random number between 19 and 120 at start of the game. 

A Player's goal is to match that random number, which can be achieved by clicking on the four crytals on the page. 

Each crystal itself generates a random number between 1 and 12, which stays constant until the game restarts. 

A Player accumulates points generated by the crystals, and can win by matching the Player's total score to the random number; otherwise, a Player loses the game if his/her total score goes above the random number.
